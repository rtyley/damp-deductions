The story I am about to tell you should not be interesting. I used to be embarrassed about even mentioning it.

Yet over the past few weeks, as I've started to relate this story to my friends and family, all have reacted with at least some interest, most of them 
with _extreme_ interest, drawn in by the intrigue of the case, and none of them have had the common decency to tell me "Shut the hell up Roberto, this 
story is about as interesting as watching paint dry".

This story is about watching paint dry. And then get wet again. Then dry, fleetingly, before becoming flickeringly wet once more. This story is 
deeply, enchantingly, about that, and the hunt to find the unknown _reason_ for its dampness, hidden behind a solid wall of uncertainty, 
unknowability, and… well… wall.

As I begin to tell my story, you will begin to form your own theories. "It's the washing machine!" you will say, or "It definitely gets worse with 
rain".

But the truth is, we don't know. Nobody _knows_. And the only way we're going to solve this thing is with the scientific method of deduction.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
